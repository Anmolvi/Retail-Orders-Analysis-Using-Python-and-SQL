Retail Orders Analysis Using Python and SQL

📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail order data (9,994 rows, 16 columns) from Kaggle to uncover insights on sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance.
The analysis demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics process — from data cleaning and transformation in Python to advanced SQL queries for business insights.


🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy

Database: MySQL

Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional for visualization)

IDE: Jupyter Notebook


📂 Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle Retail Orders Dataset

Shape: 9,994 rows × 16 columns

Period Covered: 2022–2023

Key Columns:
Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Product ID, Cost Price, List Price, Quantity, Discount Percent


🧹 Data Preparation Steps

Imported CSV data using pandas.read_csv().

Cleaned missing values ("Not Available", "unknown" → NaN).

Created calculated columns:

Unit Selling Price = List Price − (List Price × Discount %)

Unit Profit = Unit Selling Price − Cost Price

Total Sale = Unit Selling Price × Quantity

Total Profit = Unit Profit × Quantity

Converted Order Date to datetime format.

Removed unnecessary columns (Cost Price, List Price, Discount Percent).

Exported cleaned data to MySQL using SQLAlchemy.
